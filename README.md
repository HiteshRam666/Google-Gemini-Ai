## **What is Google Gemini?**

Google Gemini is a family of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) large language models that have capabilities in language, audio, code and video understanding.

Gemini 1.0 was announced on Dec. 6, 2023, and was built by Alphabet's Google DeepMind business unit, which is focused on advanced AI research and development. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is credited with helping develop the Gemini large language models (LLMs), alongside other Google staff.

At its release, Gemini was the most advanced set of LLMs at Google, superseding the company's Pathways Language Model (PaLM 2), which was released on May 10, 2023. As was the case with PaLM 2, Gemini is integrated into multiple Google technologies providing generative AI capabilities. Among the most visible user-facing examples of Gemini in action is the Google Bard AI chatbot, which was previously powered by PaLM 2.

Gemini integrates natural language processing capabilities, providing the ability to understand and process language, which is used to comprehend input queries, as well as data. It also has image understanding and recognition capabilities that enable parsing of complex visuals, such as charts and figures, without the need for external optical character recognition (OCR).

## **What can Gemini do?**

The Google Gemini models are capable of many tasks across multiple modalities, including text, image, audio and video understanding. The multimodal nature of Gemini also enables different modalities to be combined to understand and generate an output.

Tasks that Gemini can do include the following:

- Text summarization. Gemini models can summarize content from different types of data.
- Text generation. Gemini can generate text based on a user prompt. That text can also be driven by a Q&A-type chatbot interface.
- Text translation. The Gemini models have broad multilingual capabilities, enabling translation and understanding of more than 100 languages.
- Image understanding. Gemini can parse complex visuals, such as charts, figures and diagrams, without external OCR tools. It can be used for image captioning and visual Q&A capabilities.
- Audio processing. Gemini has support for speech recognition across more than 100 languages and audio translation tasks.
- Video understanding. Gemini can process and understand video clip frames to answer questions and generate descriptions.
- Multimodal reasoning. A key strength of Gemini is multimodal reasoning, where different types of data can be mixed for a prompt to generate an output.
Code analysis and generation. Gemini can understand, explain and generate code in popular programming languages, including Python, Java, C++ and Go.
